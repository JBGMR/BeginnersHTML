Hi there!

This is a basic website preset to help you build your own site. It is already set up to work on mobile and everything, that has to be linked, is already
linked together, so you can start right away! It also contains comments from me to help you understand the code.

In 2 hours, your site can look like this:
https://www.bit.ly/jbiernacik (MARKED AS NOT SAFE FOR SOME REASON, SO HERE THE SAFE DIRECT LINK: https://jbgmr.github.io/JanBiernacik/index.html )


Not perfect, but it's alright!

Some HTML basics:
--------------------------------------------------

<p> = normal text

<h1> = big title

<h2> = title

<h3> = smaller title

<h4> = small title

<h5> = very small title

<h6> = very tiny title

<a> = link

<a href="http://www.youtube.com">Youtube</a> = A link, that shows Youtube and redirects to youtube.com when you click it.

<h1>Hello World</h1> = A title, that says "Hello World"

<p>I like bananas</p> = A text, that says "I like bananas"

<img> = An Image

<img src="banana.jpg" alt="A really nice banana"> = A picture of a banana (If it exists in your root directory. If not, use the full url.), with the comment "A really nice banana"

<video> = A video

------------------------------------------------------
ready? OK, let's go!
